# nmithacks

A new Flutter project.

## Introduction
Our project Saathi is a women safety app with a difference.
The main motivation behind our project is to help women get help in time, in times of need especially in case of 
sexual harassment. 
After a literature survey of the existing technologies and apps we realised that there are not many solutions in 
the market that provide help in time, all they provide is sending SOS messages to the pre saved contacts and the police station who are always never in time.
Majority of these crimes take place in residential area's where people like you and me can help the victim by reaching the spot of crime in time and here is our solution SAATHI for this very purpose.

# Functionalities
It is a network of noble people trying to help each other in times of need and make this society a safer place to live in.
Here are the main functionalitites of this app:
1. Send an SOS on the press of a button to the nearest users within a particular radius, emergency contacts and nearest police stations.
2. Managing the user data like email,name,phone number,etc on our cloud storage.
3. Connect people who geniuenly care and want to help the society become a better place.

# Tech stack
The tech stack used are:
1. Flutter for frontend UI development(due to its hybrid platform support).
2. Firebase and firestore for storing the user data and managing backend.
